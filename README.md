# Alexa Skill Coding Practice

This project is my first attempt at building an Alexa skill. It is a simple random complement generator. I tested and successfully executed it using the Alexa Developer Console and AWS Lambda.

### Example Usage

1. Launch the skill with the voice command "Alexa, run complement", or "Alexa, start complement".
2. Upon launching, Alexa greets the user with "Welcome to complement, you're looking handsome today!"
3. When ready for a complement, the user may tell Alexa, "Give me a complement", and Alexa will randomly respond with a complement from a short list of scripted complements.
